  <div class="flow">
    <p>In another universe, I never replied.</p>
    <p>Your words felt sharp.</p>
    <p>Guarded. Defensive.</p>
    <p>I mistook strength for distance.</p>
    <p>And we faded before we began.</p>
  </div>

<section class="chapter cool">
  <div class="flow">
    <p>But in this universe, I stayed.</p>
    <p>We kept talking.</p>
    <p>Midnight conversations stretched longer.</p>
    <p>The distance between cities started shrinking.</p>
    <p>You hesitated when I asked you to come to Bangalore.</p>
    <p>But you came.</p>

<section class="chapter neutral">
  <div class="flow">
    <p>In some timelines, I never made dosa.</p>
    <p>In this one, I tried.</p>
    <p>It wasn’t perfect.</p>
    <p>You were skeptical.</p>
    <p>You tasted it anyway.</p>
    <p>Something shifted.</p>

<section class="chapter rain">
  <div class="flow">
    <p>Thirty days together.</p>
    <p>Shivanasamudra Falls roaring beside us.</p>
    <p>Isha Foundation in quiet stillness.</p>
    <p>Nandi Hills at dawn.</p>
    <p>Wayanad wrapped in mist.</p>
    <p>In another universe, it was casual.</p>
    <p>In this one, it wasn’t.</p>
  </div>

<section class="chapter neutral">
  <div class="flow">
    <p>You went back home.</p>
    <p>Distance returned.</p>
    <p>But thinner.</p>
    <p>Marriage wasn’t a fantasy.</p>
    <p>It became inevitable.</p>
    <p>Convincing families wasn’t easy.</p>
    <p>But love outlasted hesitation.</p>

    <p>Months later, I flew to Delhi.</p>
    <p>Pre-wedding lights. Cameras flashing.</p>
    <p>Seeing you again felt unreal.</p>
    <p>Like timelines had merged correctly.</p>
  </div>

<section class="chapter golden">
  <div class="flow">
    <p>Engagement in Aligarh.</p>
    <p>You in gold.</p>
    <p>I forgot how to breathe.</p>
    <p>In other universes, I watched someone else stand beside you.</p>
    <p>Not this one.</p>

<section class="chapter wedding">
  <div class="flow">
    <p>March 5th, 2024. Haldi.</p>
    <p>Laughter spilling everywhere.</p>
    <p>March 6th.</p>
    <p>You entered in red.</p>
    <p>Radiant.</p>
    <p>Walking toward me.</p>
    <p>In that moment, all other universes felt distant.</p>
    <p>Garlands exchanged.</p>
    <p>I felt chosen.</p>

    <p>Back in Bangalore.</p>
    <p>Then the call.</p>
    <p>Scientist at Indian Space Research Organisation.</p>
    <p>In another universe, doubt won.</p>
    <p>In this one, belief did.</p>

    <p>Sakleshpur. Udupi.</p>
    <p>Four days of relentless rain.</p>
    <p>A thousand kilometers on a bike.</p>
    <p>Completely soaked.</p>
    <p>Completely alive.</p>
    <p>Some love stories are written in candlelight.</p>
    <p>Ours was written in monsoon rain.</p>

    <p>Ahmedabad became home.</p>
    <p>Dwarka. Somnath. Nashik.</p>
    <p>Daman. Mumbai.</p>
    <p>Each city another confirmation.</p>

    <p>After Mumbai came the quiet miracle.</p>
    <p>You were pregnant.</p>
    <p>No fireworks.</p>
    <p>Just stillness.</p>
    <p>In countless universes, this moment doesn’t exist.</p>
    <p>In this one, it does.</p>

    <p>There are infinite versions of us.</p>
    <p>Ones who never met.</p>
    <p>Ones who gave up.</p>
    <p>Ones who chose differently.</p>
    <p class="final">But this is the universe where I met you.</p>
    <p class="final">And I would choose it again. Every time.</p>
